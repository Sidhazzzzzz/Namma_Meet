- ⚡ **Fast & Responsive**: Built with Vite for optimal performance

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Mapping**: MapLibre GL JS
- **Routing API**: OSRM (Open Source Routing Machine)
- **Geocoding**: Nominatim (OpenStreetMap)
- **Styling**: Custom CSS with CSS Variables

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd mf
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

## Usage

1. Enter your **starting point** (e.g., "Indiranagar, Bengaluru")
2. Enter your **destination** (e.g., "Koramangala, Bengaluru")
3. Click **Find Safe Routes**
4. View the routes on the map with color-coded safety indicators:
   - 🟢 Green: Safest route (75-100 safety score)
   - 🟠 Orange: Moderate safety (50-74 safety score)
   - 🔴 Red: Caution advised (0-49 safety score)
5. Click on any route card or route line to highlight it

## How Safety Scores Work

The safety score is calculated by:
1. Analyzing the route path against known crime hotspots
2. Calculating proximity to crime areas (within 500m radius)
3. Weighting by crime severity (1-10 scale)
4. Normalizing to a 0-100 score where 100 is the safest
